**In-Place Quicksort**
- Partition method returns the index at which the pivot element ended up so that we can make recursive calls to our sort.
- Base case: if the array length is less than two

**Mock Interview Question**
Write an in-place instance method on the array class that will find the kth smallest element in O(n) time. You will likely want to use a partition method similarly to if not exactly the same as that which you used for QuickSort! For a bonus ,how can we eliminate any extra space cost?
