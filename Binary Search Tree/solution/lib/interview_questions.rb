# LCA: 
# In a binary search tree, an *ancestor* of a `example_node` is a node 
# that is on a higher level than `example_node`, and can be traced directly 
# back to `example_node` without going up any levels. (I.e., this is 
# intuitively what you think an ancestor should be.) Every node in a binary 
# tree shares at least one ancestor -- the root. In this exercise, write a 
# function that takes in a BST and two nodes, and returns the node that is the 
# lowest common ancestor of the given nodes. Assume no duplicate values.
